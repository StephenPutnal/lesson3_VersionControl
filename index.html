            <p class="lead">A version control system is a great tool for developers and tech students working on projects that could be used in a portfolio. It's also a good tool for developers who are working on a project together or for an organization or tech company where some people might be more experienced in coding than others. A version control system can viewed as a tree with branches. The main line of code is the tree and when someone takes the code and alters or debugs/fixes the code that is like the branch that branches off. A version control is a safe way to edit code without making the mistake of overwriting the code and then having to debug your newly typed edits. </p>

            <p class="lead">
                One of the great things about Git is that you don't necessarily need access to another computer or remote access to your own files. This aspect makes Git extremely fast being that it doesn't need the connection speed to connect to another device. For example if you needed your history you would not have to connect to the Git server but instead to your own local device. Bypassing that connection makes Git extremely fast. Instead of contacting the server Git contacts your local repositories from the past and can do a difference calculation to determine the difference. I highly recommend using Git for this feature.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands were made with safety in mind. Git commands move your files in a safe and secure way. The first command is "git init" which initializes the repository. To access the repository remotely you would use the git remote add origin "the url here", this moves the origin to the url specified. The next command is "Git add"(note that you do not use the quotations like I have above). The "Git add" command adds the repository to the staging area to prep it for the next area or stage. Git commit -m "..." officially moves the repository out of the shopping cart or staging area into the branch for you to work on or edit.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a few different ways to create a Git repository. One way is to create a repository on your local system. Enter your terminal. For Linux the command is $ cd /home/user/your_repository. For Mac $ cd /Users/user/your_repository. For Windows the command is $ cd /c/user/your_repository. After you use that command type $ git init to initialize the repository. Note the dollar sign is usually already there so need to type that again.

                <span class="text-muted">Cloning in Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you are interested in cloning a repository there is also some sweet commands for that to. The command is Git clone. Using this command lets you clone a repository and work on it yourself without effecting the original files and repository. To be more precise(which is highly important when coding) us Git clone 'and the URL of the repository placed here". This will create the last directory name in the URL, initialize a .git under that respository, pulls down all the data for repository, and checks the latest copy of the latest version. There is another way to type this command which is $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit which will also name the repository names mylibgit.  </p>
